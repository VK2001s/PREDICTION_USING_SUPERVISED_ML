# Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning
This project aims to predict the scores of students based on the number of study hours using supervised machine learning techniques. It utilizes a small dataset containing information about the number of hours students studied and their corresponding scores.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of two columns:

Hours: The number of hours a student studied.
Scores: The corresponding scores achieved by the student.

# Project Description
The project involves building a predictive model using supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the scores of students based on the number of study hours. The following steps are followed in the project:
# Data Exploration: 
The dataset is analyzed to understand its structure and any patterns or relationships between the variables.
# Data Preprocessing: 
The dataset is prepared for model training by handling missing values, if any, and performing feature scaling or normalization if required.
# Model Training:
Various supervised machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision tree, or random forest, are trained on the dataset to learn the relationship between study hours and scores.
Here I use linear regression.
# Model Evaluation: 
The trained models are evaluated using suitable evaluation metrics to assess their performance and determine the most accurate model.
# Prediction: 
Once the best-performing model is identified, it is used to make predictions on new data or unseen study hours to estimate the corresponding scores.

# Results
The project aims to provide accurate predictions of student scores based on study hours. The performance of different machine learning algorithms is evaluated, and the best-performing model is identified. The results of the prediction can be utilized for various purposes, such as understanding the impact of study hours on academic performance or identifying students who may need additional support.
